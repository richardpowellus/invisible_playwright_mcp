browser it means.

Read from the SOURCE with `ast`, because the defect this guards does not fail:
a tool that reached the piece of work some other way - `work._open[...]`, a
`work.session(...)` of its own - would act on `main` whatever the caller asked,
or skip the sentence that says the browser is gone, and every test that drives
it with `main` open would stay green.
