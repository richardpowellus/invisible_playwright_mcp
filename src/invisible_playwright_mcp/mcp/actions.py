"""The browser operations, as plain functions over a session.

This module is the only implementation. The MCP tools in `server.py` are a thin
wrapper over it, and anything else that drives the browser - the built-in chat,
a test, a script - calls the same functions rather than reimplementing them.

That constraint is the point of the file. A second path to the page would give
two behaviours to keep in step, and they would drift: the tool would grow a
timeout the chat never got, the chat would grow a retry the tool never got, and
the difference would surface as a bug report nobody could reproduce.

Nothing here knows what MCP is, or what a session id is. It takes a session and
acts on it.

    ⛔ IT EXISTS BECAUSE ITS ABSENCE PUSHED MODELS INTO A DETECTABLE WORKAROUND.
    Measured on a four-field form: with no way to set a select, the model clicked
    it, pressed ArrowDown twice hoping to land on the right row, could not tell
    whether it had, and finally set `select.value` through `browser_evaluate`.
    That last step is script injection into the page - it skips the humanised
    path entirely and produces a change the site never saw a real interaction
    for. A missing tool is not a neutral gap: the model routes around it, and the
    route it finds is worse than the tool would have been.

    BOTH value and label, because a model reads the page and what a page shows
    is the LABEL. Asking it for the `value` attribute means asking it to read
    markup it may never have fetched, and a tool that needs the caller to know a
    hidden attribute is a tool that gets used wrong.

    ⛔ ONE ATTEMPT, BECAUSE THE DRIVER ALREADY MATCHES BOTH. `value=` reaches it
    as `valueOrLabel`, which selects an option whose value OR whose label is
    the string. This used to try the value and then, on failure, the label -
    and the second attempt could only fail where the first had, after waiting
    its own full timeout. Measured: a selector matching nothing failed after
    30.2 s, two timeouts, where a click on the same selector took 15.1 s.
    `tests/test_a_failed_selector_says_what_to_do.py` holds the driver to that

# ⛔ WITHOUT THIS, AN UPLOAD WAS IMPOSSIBLE, AND IMPOSSIBLE IS NOT NEUTRAL. A
# file input takes nothing from the keyboard and nothing from browser_evaluate,
# so a credit application's "Supporting Documents" page (measured 2026-10-01)
# was the end of the road: the model could click "Add Document", watch a chooser
# open that no tool could answer, and stop. The way past it a model finds next
# is script - a DataTransfer built in the page and assigned to `input.files`,
# which is exactly the untrusted change this package exists to avoid.
#
# The file chooser is what a person uses, so the chooser is what this answers:
# the real pointer clicks what opens it and the files go in through the
# engine's own file-input path, with the input and change events a picked file
# produces, after the time a person takes to pick them.
#
# ⛔ AND A HIDDEN INPUT IS OPENED THROUGH WHAT A PERSON CLICKS, NEVER FED. The
# usual shape is a styled button or label in front of an `<input type=file>`
# nobody can see, and the first version gave such an input the files directly:
# the page then heard `input` and `change` on a control no pointer had touched,
# with no click anywhere before it, which no person can produce. So the label
# that opens it is clicked instead, and when there is none the caller is told
# to name the button that does.
#
# ⛔ AND IT READS ONLY FROM DIRECTORIES SOMEBODY NAMED. This hands a local file
# to a remote page, and the model choosing the path is driven by pages it has
# read. With no list there are no uploads at all, rather than a default that

# ── evaluate, and the one thing it must not be used for ─────────────────────
#
# ⛔ THIS PACKAGE EXISTS SO THAT INTERACTION LOOKS REAL, AND A VALUE SET FROM
# SCRIPT IS THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. `el.value = 'beta'` changes the field without
# a keystroke, without focus, without a trusted event; `el.click()` fires a
# handler with `isTrusted === false`, which is one property read away from being
# the clearest bot signal a page can collect. Every other tool here goes through
# the humanised path - approach, hover, press, release - and this one would go
# around it.
#
# It is not a hypothetical. Measured 2026-09-02, first run with a real model:
# asked to pick an option from a dropdown, with no tool that could, it clicked
# the select, pressed ArrowDown twice, and then ran `s.value='beta'` through
# here. The model was not being careless - it was routing around a gap, which is
# what a capable model does. The gap is the defect; this refusal is what makes
# the gap visible instead of silently detectable.
#
# So the fix is in two halves and both are needed. The gaps are closed
# (`browser_select_option` exists, and the snapshot reports `checked` and the
# selected `value`, which is what sent it here to READ in the first place), and
# the shortcut is refused with the name of the tool to use instead. Closing the
# gaps alone leaves the shortcut for the next gap; refusing alone leaves the
# model stuck with a task it can see how to finish.
#
# ⛔ AND THIS IS A PATTERN CHECK, NOT A SANDBOX. JavaScript has unlimited ways
# to say the same thing and this catches the ones a model actually writes. It is
# a guardrail on the obvious road, not a wall around the field, and it must not
# be described as one anywhere.
