"""A selector that fails says why, and what to do about it - from every tool.

⛔ THREE TOOLS TAKE A SELECTOR AND ONLY ONE OF THEM COULD EXPLAIN A FAILURE.
`browser_click` asked the page why and reported it. `browser_type` and
`browser_select_option` handed back Playwright's bare timeout, which names the
selector and nothing else. The same page, the same failure, and the answer was
useful or useless depending on which tool the caller happened to reach for.

⛔ AND THE ANSWER THAT WAS MISSING ALTOGETHER IS THE COMMONEST ONE: nothing
matches. Measured on a real run, on a real site: the model wrote
`.inbox-dataentry a, .inbox a, [class*="mail-item"] a`, waited the full fifteen
seconds for nothing, and then spent four more `browser_evaluate` calls hunting
through the DOM by hand before it thought of taking a fresh snapshot - which
worked first time.

It could not have read those class names anywhere in this product.
`browser_snapshot` builds its `selector` from id, name, href, data-testid or
aria-label, never from class; `browser_read_html` drops the class attribute
outright. So a class-based selector is ALWAYS one the caller wrote, the product
knew that, and it did not say so at the only moment it mattered.

That is what these tests hold: one place decides what follows from what the page
reported, and every tool that aims at a selector goes through it.
