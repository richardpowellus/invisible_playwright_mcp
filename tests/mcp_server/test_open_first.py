"""The lifecycle of a browser, which since 0.53.0 is short enough to test in
one file: `browser_open` opens, every other tool needs an open browser and says
so when there is none, a browser that died is said and not brought back, and
what survives a process is who `main` was.

No browser starts here. The piece of work gets a factory that launches nothing
and records what it was handed, and `actions.navigate` is a stub that writes
the url down - so what is under test is the decisions, never the engine.
