"""One piece of work: the two browsers this process serves, and the file that
says who `main` is.

⛔ OPEN FIRST, AND NOTHING ELSE OPENS A BROWSER. Until 0.53.0 the lifecycle had
seven steps - declare, wake, look, act, rebuild, remember, close - because a
command aimed at a browser that was not running STARTED one, and an action
whose browser had died REBUILT it and ran the action again. Each of those was
a place to be wrong, and both were: the wake reopened pages the file had noted
and blamed the site for them; the rebuild fired on a domain that did not
resolve and threw away a healthy browser with its cookies ([B203]); a rebuild
was silent, then said, then a type. The owner cut it on 2026-09-14: a browser
is opened by `browser_open`, a tool whose browser is not open says so and says
what to call, and a browser that died says that instead and is not brought
back behind the model's back. What is left:

  open      `open(role, ...)` plans a browser and starts it; with no arguments
            it reopens `main` as the person this session already was.
  act       `acting(fn, ...)` runs one action on an open browser. Not open, or
            gone: the sentence, never a start and never a retry.
  look      `listing()` and `status()` describe what is open.
  remember  `open` writes who `main` is; nothing else writes the file.
  close     `close(role)` closes one browser and keeps who it was, so that a
            `browser_open` with no arguments brings the same person back;
            `close_all()` at the end of the process.

Normally there is one per process, built from `INVISIBLE_MCP_SESSION_ID`.
Trusted mcpd owner mode holds one ephemeral piece of work per caller.
A test builds its own with a factory that launches no browser.

#: TWO browsers in one piece of work, with fixed roles, and the number is a
#: decision rather than a measurement - the opposite of what it was until
#: 2026-09-11.
#:
#: It used to be eight, and the eight was measured: 61 processes and 6,515 MB,
#: the eighth taking 13.6 s to start against the first one's 6.8. Nothing about
#: that stopped being true. What changed is what a session MEANS. Identity lives
#: on the browser - seed, fingerprint, profile - so a session holding eight
#: browsers held eight identities while everything above it, the transcript and
#: the saved state and anything a person attaches to a session, was addressed
#: to one. "Whose is this?" had two possible answers and no way to choose.
#:
#: So a session is ONE identity, `main`, plus ONE helper beside it, `support`,
#: for the things that must not touch that identity: a temporary mailbox to
#: receive a verification, a lookup, a second opinion on a page. It is a
#: browser and not a tab because a tab would share cookies and fingerprint with
#: the site the identity is being built on, and the whole point of the helper
#: is that it does not. The helper is not saved - it dies with the process -
#: because a helper that survives IS a second identity, which is the thing this
#: number exists to rule out.
#:
#: The roles are NAMES A CALLER CANNOT INVENT. `browser` on every tool is a
#: closed choice, `main` or `support`, so nothing here ever holds a browser
#: called `b3` or `walmart-jobs` again.
MAX_BROWSERS_PER_SESSION = 2

#: The launch settings that say WHO a browser is, and so the ones the saved
#: file carries. Everything else in the launch kwargs describes THIS LAUNCH -
#: the engine it runs on, whether its window is shown - and is decided by
#: `plan.launched_here` every time, never read back from a file. Both halves
#: were measured by getting them wrong: `binary_path` saved would reopen a
#: browser onto a path that means nothing on another machine, and `headless`
#: saved (until 0.50.0) made one headed run decide for every later process
#: that read the same file.
#:
#: ⛔ THESE ARE THE LAUNCH KWARGS' OWN NAMES, NOT THE TOOL ARGUMENTS' NAMES:
#: this list said `profile` for its first day, the launch kwarg is
#: `profile_dir`, so the filter matched nothing and the profile - the one
#: field that carries the logins a reopened browser is FOR - was never saved.
WHO_A_BROWSER_IS = ("seed", "proxy", "profile_dir")

#: What `browser_open` says about a seed it read back from the file.
REMEMBERED = "the person this session already was"

#: How long `open` gives the engine to say whether it is a cache hit or a
#: download: the core reads its stamp, sweeps orphans and resolves the release
#: asset before it reports the first phase, and the last of those is a network
#: round trip. Past this, the answer is "its download is starting" and the
#: caller asks again; nothing here waits for a transfer.
ENGINE_SETTLE_SECONDS = 10.0

#: The longest a typing call waits before it answers, finished or not; past
#: it the typing goes on in the background (`Work.typing`). The bound
#: `browser_navigate` gives a page to load, which is the longest any tool here
#: already waited inside one call, so no call waits longer than it did before.

        nothing replaced them. The interface believed it: it draws a dot on
