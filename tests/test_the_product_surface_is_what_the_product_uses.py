"""Nothing in the product may exist only for the suite.

⛔ THIS IS A GATE ON A CLASS, NOT A LIST OF NAMES THAT WERE REMOVED. Seven
surfaces came out of `src/invisible_playwright_mcp` in one audit and every one of them was the
same shape: a function, a constant or a method with no caller in the product,
kept alive by the tests that had grown up around it.

  * `agent.run_task` - a second way to run the agent loop, taking an object
    shaped like the pre-`Link` world. About twenty-five tests, zero product
    callers. It is now `tests/_loop.py`.
  * `Sessions.around` - a constructor whose docstring offered "and so would
    anything embedding this", a user that does not exist. Eleven callers, all
    tests. It is now `tests/_sessions.py`.
  * `SessionPlan.describe` - a second mapping of a plan onto the sentence a
    caller is told, beside the one in `work.open`. Six callers, all tests.
  * `clean.relevance` and `clean.clean_stats` - fifty-seven lines of scoring and
    seven figures of savings, arriving dead with the server on 2026-09-06 and
    never called by anything. `clean_stats` was even in `__all__`.
  * `clean.BLOCK_TAGS` - a tuple nothing read.
  * `Sessions._open_link` as an attribute reassigned from outside - a seam that
    worked and that nothing declared. It is a parameter now.

A list of those seven names would stop those seven. The defect is not the seven:
it is that a surface can be added, be used only by its own tests, and look
exactly like a surface the product depends on. So the question this asks is the
general one - is this named anywhere in `src`? - and the answer has to be yes.

⛔ WHAT IT LOOKS AT, MEASURED, BECAUSE A GREEN SAYS WHAT IT CHECKED AND NOT WHAT
EXISTS. Two scans, and they answer two different questions.

  * `unnamed` - top-level functions, classes and upper-case constants across the
    package: 178 of them in 25 modules, with 18 more exempt because they are
    registered (below). A name at module level is unambiguous, so counting is
    enough.
  * `uncalled` - methods: 47 of them, out of the 59 defined. The twelve left out
    are methods of a class WITH A BASE, which may be satisfying somebody else's
    contract so the caller is the base's, and methods carrying a decorator,
    which can hand them somewhere this cannot follow. Counting is NOT enough
    here, and saying so is what the first version of this file did instead of
    doing the work:
    `plan.describe(...)` and `SessionPlan.describe(...)` are the same attribute
    name, so a scan that counts names cannot tell the dead method from the live
    function beside it. It is separated by resolving the OWNER - an attribute on
    a name that this file imported as a MODULE is the module's function and
    never the method - which is exactly the confusion that let
    `SessionPlan.describe` live, and it is now the thing the scan looks for.

Anything nested inside a function is out of scope for both: it cannot be reached
from outside in the first place. So is the page - `src/invisible_playwright_mcp/ui/js` and
`src/invisible_playwright_mcp/ui/css` are product surface too, and they were scanned the same way
by hand: 109 top-level JS bindings, all named by another file or by the markup,
and 49 CSS classes, all applied. They carry no gate here because the page is one
concatenated script and its own gates live in
`tests/test_the_browser_workspace.py`.

⛔ WHAT EXCUSES A DEFINITION IS BEING REGISTERED, WHICH IS STRUCTURAL. A
decorator spelled `.tool`, `.command` or `.group` hands the object to somebody
else - FastMCP's registry, click's - and the call that follows happens over a
wire or from a shell, where no scan of this tree can see it. `@dataclass`,
`@contextmanager` and `@asynccontextmanager` do NOT excuse anything: they wrap
the object and hand it straight back, so it is still called by name and still has
to be.

⛔ AND `__all__` IS NOT EVIDENCE. It is the claim under audit - "this module
exports this" - so a name that appears only there counts as unused. That is
exactly where `clean_stats` was hiding: exported, tested, called by nobody.
