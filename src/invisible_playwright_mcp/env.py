"""What this package reads from the environment, and what it still answers to.

⛔ THE NAMES LIVE HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE, BECAUSE FROM 2026-09-23 EACH OF THEM IS
TWO STRINGS: the name it has, and the name it had. Before that they were one
string each and a literal at the single place that read it was the right shape.
Two strings each is not: three modules read one of these and a fourth writes
one, so the pair would be six literals, and a rename that reaches five of them
is the silent kind. One house, and every caller asks it.

The old prefix was the product's previous brand. It was kept through the package
rename on the reasoning that somebody who had set it would otherwise find it
IGNORED, which is the worst way to break a configuration; the owner then asked
for the name to be abandoned outright. Both things are true at once, and this
module is how: the new name is the only one the product emits, documents or
teaches, and the old one still ANSWERS, out loud.

Precedence, when both are set: the new name wins. It is the more recent
decision, the same reasoning that makes the shell beat `.env` in `cli.py`.

`read` says so through the logger rather than a print, on purpose. stdout is the
MCP protocol channel and a print there corrupts the stream; the logger's default
destination is stderr, which a client discards and a person at a terminal sees.
Once per name per process, because a warning repeated on every lookup is a
warning people filter out.
