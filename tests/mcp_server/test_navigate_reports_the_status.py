"""`browser_navigate` has to say what came back, not just that it went.

The tool answered `navigated to {url}` whatever happened. A model that asked for
a page and got 404, 403 or 500 was handed the same sentence as one that got 200,
and then read the error document as if it were content - there was nothing in
the reply to read differently. This is the defect `test_describe_pages.py` states
in general: a tool's reply is the API documentation handed to a MODEL, which
cannot go and check the code when it looks wrong.

The second half is quieter. After a redirect the url in that sentence was the
one ASKED FOR, so an agent that followed a shortener, hit a login wall, or was
sent to a regional domain was told it had arrived somewhere it had not.

Both halves are read off the Response now. That value only exists from
invisible-playwright 0.13.2: before it, `page.goto()` answered None on every
navigation, which is why the dependency floor moved in the same change and why
the None branch here must NOT be reachable by an ordinary page.

Known-bad inputs, each run against this file before it was trusted:

* the old `return f"navigated to {url}"` -> the status test and the redirect
  test go red;
* reporting `url` instead of `response.url` -> the redirect test goes red;
* dropping the None branch -> the same-document test raises AttributeError
  instead of answering;
* answering the None branch for every page (what an older wheel would do) ->
  the status test goes red, which is the point of the floor.
