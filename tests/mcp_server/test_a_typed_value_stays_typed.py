"""browser_type waits for the page to answer the focus, and says what the field kept.

Measured on a real form (Angular, a store whose every emission writes the
stored answer into its inputs): "30" typed into a field was gone a second
later, and an email typed after a masked date kept only its last letters, and
both calls answered "typed into". Two causes. The engine's `fill` focuses and
presses the first key in the same breath, so the page's answer to the focus
lands on top of what is arriving; and the answer was a claim about the call,
never a reading of the field.

The first fix retyped whatever looked dropped, and that is not idempotent: a
chip field that turns `a@b.io,` into a chip took the text the first time, and a
retry made a second chip. It also called a one-time code spread over six boxes
an error, because the first box keeps one digit by design. So nothing is
retyped; each shape is named for what it is.

The pause before the first key is the engine's own `fill` since
invisible-playwright 0.25.8, for every caller; this server used to add it in
front of `fill` and adds nothing now. The unit tests hold the sentences and
that the server adds no pause of its own; the e2e ones hold six real shapes -
an ordinary field, a field that keeps digits only, a maxlength, a code split
across boxes, a chip field and a store field - against a real engine.
