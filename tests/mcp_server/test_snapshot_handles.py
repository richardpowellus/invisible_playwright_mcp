"""The selector the snapshot hands out must reach one element, and the right one.

Measured 2026-09-02 across 969 interactive elements on real pages: 88.1% carried
an id, a name or an href, and every one of those selectors reached the element it
came from. But before this, only 47.6% reached it ALONE.

For the other 40% the obvious selector matches several nodes, and Playwright acts
on the first. A model looking at the third of five identical links builds
`a[href='/x']`, clicks, and is told it worked. Nothing raises, nothing is logged,
and the wrong thing happened. That is the failure mode this file exists for: not
an error, a quiet substitution.

The source checks run without a browser, because the mechanism lives in a JS
string. The end-to-end ones share ONE browser through a module fixture: three
parametrized cases plus two separate tests meant five launches and over two
minutes, and a launch is the most expensive thing in this suite.
