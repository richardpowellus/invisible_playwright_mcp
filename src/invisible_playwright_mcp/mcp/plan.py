"""The one place that decides how a session is launched, and says so out loud.

⛔ THIS MODULE EXISTS BECAUSE THE SAME FACT WAS COMPUTED IN TWO PLACES. The tool
that starts a session decided from its ARGUMENTS, and the browser launched from
`launch_kwargs(os.environ)`. Nothing kept them in agreement, so they drifted in
the way two copies always drift, and the answer handed back to the caller
described a browser that had not been started:

  * with a profile set in the environment, `identity.resolve_seed` never saw it,
    so the seed was drawn fresh on every session while the cookie jar persisted.
    Three sessions on one profile, three different fingerprints, one login. That
    is the exact tell `identity.py` was written to prevent, reintroduced by the
    code that called it.
  * the answer said `profile: none, so nothing survives this session` while a
    persistent profile was open.
  * `identity.py` was only ever reached from one optional tool, so the whole
    identity decision was skipped on the path the tool descriptions actively
    recommend ("you do not have to call it at all").

So there is now one function. It takes what the caller said and what the
environment says, decides everything once, and returns both the kwargs the
browser is launched with AND the sentence describing them. The sentence cannot
disagree with the launch because it is derived from the same object.

`config.launch_kwargs` was the second reader and is gone: it went on parsing
STEALTHFOX_PROXY after the exit had been decided here, so a malformed value
nobody was going to use still killed the session. Every STEALTHFOX_* variable
now has exactly one reader, and it is in this file.
