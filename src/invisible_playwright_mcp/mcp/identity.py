"""Who the browser is for one session: the seed, and where it is remembered.

⛔ THE SEED AND THE PROFILE ARE ONE DECISION, NOT TWO, and getting that wrong is
the reason this module exists rather than a couple of lines in the server.

A profile directory is asked for because somebody wants to stay logged in. If
the seed is drawn fresh each time, the same cookie jar comes back wearing
different hardware on every visit: same account, same session cookies, a new
screen, a new GPU, new fonts. That is a stronger signal than either half on its
own, and it is exactly the class of tell this product exists to remove.

So a profile OWNS its seed. The first session on a new profile draws one and
writes it inside; every session after that reads it back. "This profile is this
person" becomes true by construction, and the caller never has to remember a
number to stay consistent.

Without a profile the seed is drawn fresh. Owner mode keeps that resolved
identity in memory per role until the owner expires, never on disk.
Drawn identities must fit the current X display as a whole fingerprint;
explicit and remembered identities are never resampled.

⛔ AND A DRAWN SEED IS ALWAYS REPORTED. A random identity that is not written
down cannot be reproduced, and this project debugs by re-running the same seed.
The caller is told which one it got, every time, so a session that went wrong is
still a session somebody can repeat.

    ⛔ A PROFILE OWNS ITS SEED FOR A REASON THAT APPLIES JUST AS MUCH TO ITS
    EXIT, and until now only half of it was enforced. The argument in this
    module's docstring is that a login returning with different hardware is a
    stronger signal than either half alone. Timezone, locale and geography are
    derived from the proxy exit, so a login returning from another country is
    the same signal on the other half of the identity - and it was the half
    nothing mentioned anywhere.

    It WARNS rather than refuses, which is deliberately not what the seed does.
    A contradicting seed is refused because "use this identity" and "use this
    profile's identity" are both reasonable readings and picking one silently
    hands somebody the wrong person. An exit is not symmetric: somebody changing
    proxy usually means it, exits go down and get replaced, and refusing would
    block a session over a decision the caller already made. So it is said out
    loud and the caller decides.

    ⛔ IT COMPARES THE USERNAME TOO, WITHOUT STORING IT, and the first version of
    this did not - which made it blind to the case it claims to catch. Providers
    put the exit selector in the CREDENTIALS, not in the host: one gateway,
    `host:port` identical forever, and the country chosen by a username like
    `user-country-fr-sess-a1b2`. Comparing the credential-free `server` alone,
    two deliberately different countries looked like the same exit. So the
    comparison is over a digest of server plus username, and only the digest and
    the server are written down: the username is not recoverable from the file,
    and the password never reaches it.

    ⛔ AND IT STILL ONLY SEES WHAT WAS DECLARED. A provider that rotates its own
    addresses behind one unchanged URL is invisible from here, because nothing
    in the declaration moves. This catches a caller who CHANGED the exit, never
    a provider that rotated it. The tool description carries the same caveat: a
    check believed to be wider than it is, is worse than one nobody trusts.

    Two outcomes are right here, unlike a check that MEASURES something. There
    is no "could not be established" case to score, because the thing compared
    is the caller's own declaration, which is always known at this point.
