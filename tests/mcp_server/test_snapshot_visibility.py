"""The snapshot must see what is there and skip what is not.

Measured 2026-09-02 against the version that used `el.offsetParent !== null`: on
a page with five elements it reported three, and it was wrong in BOTH
directions.

  button position:fixed    visible     -> SKIPPED
  visibility:hidden        invisible   -> KEPT
  left:-9999px             invisible   -> KEPT
  div[role=button]         clickable   -> NEVER LOOKED FOR

`offsetParent` is `null` on any `position:fixed` element, and that is not a
laboratory configuration: it is the cookie banner, the sticky bar, the button
inside a modal. When it is the modal that blocks the page, the model does not
see it at all, so the failure is not local, it is terminal.

These tests run against the filter in isolation, without a browser: the logic
lives in a JS string, and to exercise it here it is checked against the shape of
the data that string produces. The end-to-end check with a real browser is in
test_real_launch.py.
