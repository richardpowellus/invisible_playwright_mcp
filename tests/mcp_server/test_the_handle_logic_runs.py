"""The selector the snapshot hands out, EXECUTED, with no browser.

⛔ THE MACHINE HAS A JAVASCRIPT ENGINE AND THIS GATE WAS READING STRINGS.
`SNAPSHOT_JS` is 220 lines of JavaScript inside a Python string, and the part
of it below decides the selector for every click this product makes. Its
behaviour was proven in exactly one place: `test_snapshot_handles.py`, against
a real Firefox, behind `@pytest.mark.e2e` - which the default selection
DESELECTS. So on an ordinary run, and on every pull request that does not pay
for an engine, the rule "prefer an id, then a name, then an href" was held up
by regexes over the source text, which can see that a branch exists and never
what it returns.

`node` is on this machine and on every CI runner, and three of this suite's
page gates already use it. The half of the snapshot that builds a HANDLE is
pure: element attributes in, a selector string out, with one question asked of
the document (how many nodes does this selector match). That is a fake small
enough to print. The half that decides VISIBILITY is not, and stays where it
is: it reads layout through getBoundingClientRect and getComputedStyle, and a
fake DOM for that would be fiction rather than a test.

⛔ ONE BRANCH IS DELIBERATELY NOT REACHED HERE. `cssq` prefers `CSS.escape`
when the window has it, which every real engine does and node does not, so
what runs below is the regex fallback. The escaping assertions therefore hold
the fallback to the same promise; the engine's own branch is what
`test_snapshot_handles.py` exercises against Firefox. Said plainly rather than
left for somebody to discover: a gate whose perimeter is guessed from its
green is a hope.
